===== Exercise: Make line drawing of a person; program =====
label{pysketcher:exer:person:prog}
file=draw_person.py

A very simple sketch of a human being can be made of a circle for the
head, two lines for the arms, one vertical line, a triangle, or a rectangle
for the torso, and
two lines for the legs.
Make such a drawing in a program, utilizing appropriate classes
in the `Shape` hierarchy.

===== Exercise: Make line drawing of a person; class =====
label{pysketcher:exer:person:class}
file=Person.py

Use the code from Exercise ref{pysketcher:exer:person:prog} to make a
subclass of `Shape` that draws a person.  Supply the following
arguments to the constructor: the center point of the head and the
radius $R$ of the head. Let the arms and the torso be of length $4R$,
and the legs of length $6R$.  The angle between the legs can be fixed
(say 30 degrees), while the angle of the arms relative to the torso
can be an argument to the constructor with a suitable default value.

===== Exercise: Animate a person with waving hands =====
label{pysketcher:exer:person:anim}
file=waving_person.py

Make a subclass of the class from Exercise ref{pysketcher:exer:person:class}
where the constructor can
take an argument describing the angle between the arms and the torso.
Use this new class to animate a person who waves her/his hands.
